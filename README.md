# Infinite Craft Item Creator v1.0.0a

This project is meant for the game "Infinite Craft" by Neal Agarwal on [neal.fun](neal.fun).

## How to use this script?

Make sure you have `pyperclip` installed. After that, go to [Infinite Craft](neal.fun/infinite-craft) and inspect elements. Make sure you crafted at least 1 item. Go to "Application" and under "Local Storage", click "https://neal.fun".
Find the key `infinite-craft-data` and copy the value. This is the data for Infinite Craft. Run the script and enter the data then enter the text of the item you want to add, and the emoji. Then once you're done, copy it and head back
to the website and paste in the data under the key `infinite-craft-data` and reload the page then you're done! Feel free to send any unique items you create in the feedback section.

If there are any bugs, please report them in the "Issues" tab and I'll be happy to fix them! ðŸ˜Š

_Happy Creating_
